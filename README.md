Code for Ganong and Shoag (2017) Journal of Urban Economics

## code
* `master` branch contains repkit 
* `eduardo_porter` contains analysis done in February 2019 for NYT reporter Eduardo Porter

## data
* [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kfi3zgf2dl0eb9i/AACwuqlV2hIaHRPeZygSz7mNa?dl=0) is all the data including working and out.
* [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/021z1nvxym2fmv1/AAA2Xz7UGdZ8CBEpihnbIyJPa?dl=0) is the dropbox link we give out when people ask for the repkit. In the future, we might consider migrating to git-lfs, but note that option is less good for distributing links to other people.
